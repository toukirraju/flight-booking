## Description 
This project create using React-redux to save data from the Destination From, Destination To, Journey Date, Guests, and Class fields into the Redux store when the Book button is clicked. The data from the Redux store will be displayed in a table, and only three rows can be added before the Book button becomes disabled. Clicking the Delete button in a row will delete the row and its corresponding data from the Redux store.


## Features

* When clicking the Book button after filling in Destination From, Destination To, Journey Date, Guests, and Class fields, the data will be saved in the Redux store.

* The data from the Redux store will be used to display it in a table.

* If three rows are added, the Book button will be disabled. You need to validate this. This means that only three rows can be added, and no more.

* When clicking the Delete button in a row, the row will be deleted, and the data will also be deleted from the Redux store.
